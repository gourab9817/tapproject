## Overview

TapInc helps analysts and investors quickly browse corporate bonds, read issuer-level details, and inspect financial trends (Revenue / EBITDA) with interactive charts. The codebase follows clean architecture practices to keep UI, domain, and data concerns separated and testable.

## âœ¨ Highlights

* Polished, responsive UI for phones and tablets.
* Instant local search with highlighted matches (no extra network while typing).
* Interactive charts with tooltips, gridlines, and adaptive Y-axis scaling.
* Robust networking (retry, caching) and clear error handling.

## Features

* Compact, information-rich bond cards (ISIN, issuer, rating, logo).
* Bond detail page with tabs: **Bond Info**, **ISIN Analysis**, **Pros & Cons**.
* Custom EBITDA & Revenue charts using `fl_chart` and smart scaling.
* Soft in-memory caching and graceful fallbacks for offline-like UX.
* BLoC-based state management with clear events & states.

## Architecture

The project uses a layered architecture:

* `core/` â€” DI, networking, constants, error models.
* `features/` â€” feature folders (each with `domain/`, `data/`, `presentation/`).
* `presentation/` â€” widgets, screens, and BLoCs live here.

This keeps the app maintainable and easy to test.
